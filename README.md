# Digitalization-of-the-Hospitality-Process

The application allows users to upload two CSV files to efficiently allocate rooms in hostels while ensuring group members with the same ID stay together and adhere to hostel capacities and gender-specific accommodations.

index.html -- contains the html page to upload csv files

group.csv, hostel.csv -- CSV files that contain information about group of students and hostel they will be assigned. 

allocation.html -- the web page that displays the result of the allocated hostel rooms

logic.py - contaisn the flask program behind the entire process
